# adhoc-ROS-Mobile
This is an adhoc version of the ROS-Mobile app

An Android application, based on the ROS-Mobile app\cite{rottmann2020ros}, is developed to integrate the capabilities of MQTT clients and ROS nodes on a smartphone. This way, different smartphones can play a different role within the Internet of Robotics Things or the Feedback Information System in a X-IoCA architecture, depending on whether they act as information providers or remote processors and task monitors, respectively.
