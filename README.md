# adhoc-ROS-Mobile

This is an adhoc version of the Android application for the robot operating system ROS-Mobile (Rottmann et al, 2020). The ad-hoc app is developed to integrate the capabilities of MQTT clients and ROS nodes on a smartphone. This way, different smartphones can play a different role within the Internet of Robotics Things or the Feedback Information System in a X-IoCA architecture (Bravo-Arrabal et al, 2021), depending on whether they act as information providers or remote processors and task monitors, respectively.
